## WHICH DYNAMO ARE WE TALKNG ABOUT?
***

- For Structure
- For MEP
- For Technicians (agnostic)

## DYNAMO FOR STRUCTURE 
aka INTEROPERABILITY

|PAST   | PRESENT   | FUTURE
|:----:  |   :----:  | :-----:|
|Grasshopper    |   Grasshopper     |   Grasshopper
|Geometry Gym   |   Geometry Gym    |   Speckle
|Salamander     |   Dynamo          |   Cloud based services

 Note: bespoke scripts like design check libraries, export PBP SP coordinates from multiple models. Rhino embedded in Revit
---

## FOR MEP
aka SIMPLIFICATION

|PAST   | PRESENT   | FUTURE
|:----:  |   :----:  | :-----:|
|External Parties Addins    |   Dynamo     |   Arup Addins
|          ?                 |  External Parties Addins    |   Dynamo
|           ?                |      ?     |   Cloud based services

## FOR TECHNICIANS
aka AUTOMATION

|PAST   | PRESENT   | FUTURE
|:----:  |   :----:  | :-----:|
|Arup Cad Tools    |   Arup Cad Tools     |   Arup Cad Tools
|External Parties Addins |  Dynamo    |   Macro/External commands
|           ?                |    External Parties Addins       |   Dynamo

---

## DYNAMO PLAYGROUND
***

|PROS       | CONS      |
| :-----:   | :-----:   |
|Low entry barrier | Not developed by Arup
|Quickly test ideas | Silos
|Easy to share | No version control/update

Note: silos = scripts developed works in Dynamo only. No central repository, impossible to centrally manage updates. 

---

## DESIGNCHECK FOR DYNAMO
***

1. Launch Revit -> 50 seconds
2. Open a project -> 2 minutes
3. Launch Dynamo -> 30 seconds
4. Start working

---
## DESIGNCHECK CLOUD BASED -> ARUP COMPUTE
***

1. Calculation Library + 3D Model
2. Push data + geometry up (from Rhino)
3. Do the calcs
4. Pull down updated geometry and data into Revit (till it last)
